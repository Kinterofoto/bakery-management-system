# CLAUDE.md

Operational guidance has been moved to `AGENTS.md`.

Read `AGENTS.md` as the source of truth before making changes in this repository.

Important:
- For migrations, always use `pnpm db:sync` (or `./scripts/db-sync-push.sh`).
- Do not use `supabase db push` directly in normal workflows.
